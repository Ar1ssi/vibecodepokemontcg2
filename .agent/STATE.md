# State — the single source of "now". Edited only in commits that land on main. Cap: 25 lines.
<!-- Keep exactly these sections. Pointers, not lists: the backlog lives in ISSUES.md (top = next).
     Every stale line here taxes every session. History belongs to git log (commit messages are the
     journal). Contradicts git log? Trust git: rebuild from `git log -20 main`. -->

Focus: Build & Battle opening in 3D (design 055, S330): WebGL pillow packs with a real rip,
  cards out of the mouth, hand-off to the DOM stack, dark grey floor with reflections; every-era
  boxes (design 054, merged in) with vendored Bulbapedia/pokesymbols art (D193, D194).
Active: none (PR claude/build-battle-3d-packs → main awaiting the user's review).
Next: user look on localhost at /build-and-battle; design 056 (3D box, lid, wrap; per-box faces,
  I209); then `.agent/designs/parse-holes-next-handoff.md` items 2–5; then top of ISSUES.md.
  Maintenance: DECISIONS/designs root over cap; ISSUES open over 40 (maintain.md).
Blocked: I85/I86 need design approval (028/029); I87 needs the user's description.

## Watch-outs (≤5)
- Gates after engine changes: `pnpm audit:oracle`, `audit:abilities`, `audit:trainers`,
  `audit:attacks`; GX scope: `node scripts/audit-gx-oracle.mjs` (~25 s). Live TCGdex: `pnpm test:live`.
- FX video checks: `.claude/skills/fx-preview/rec/rec-*.mjs` (worktree server `PORT=4100 pnpm start`;
  preview_start reuses the primary's :4000). rec-unboxing runs WebGL on SwiftShader (`BOX=<key>`).
- three.js is vendored, never imported in node tests: pure math lives in pack3d.mjs; bump only via
  `scripts/vendor-three.mjs` (test checks bytes). Box art: rerun `scripts/build-battle/vendor-box-art.mjs`.
- Bash heredoc eats `\` and mangles é → use the Edit/Write tools. Primary working copy is CRLF.
- KO event names the root Basic (origins.knockoutStack). Opacity on a preserve-3d card flattens it: fade the host (043).
