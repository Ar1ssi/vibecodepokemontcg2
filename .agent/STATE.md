Session: 124
Focus: fix (board-ui) — unify playmat and zone geometry for sub-pixel card alignment
Active: done. Removed broken object-fit cover stretching, tied mat art, zones SVG overlay,
  and child playmat iframes to identical aspect-locked coordinates and dynamic --mat-scale.
  Positioned deck/discard counters dynamically. Verified sub-pixel slotting via Playwright.
Next: user visual review in browser.
Blocked: nothing.

## Watch-outs (≤5 — things the next session must know; prune ruthlessly)
- Test netcode changes in BOTH modes: `SERVER_AUTHORITATIVE=1 PORT=4100 node server/server.js`
  plus a plain legacy server; S101 shipped a legacy-only fix to a server-authoritative prod (D17).
- Sync-check must hash what the owner's view shows (hashOwnerViewZones), never raw state, and
  skips the compare on a stateVersion mismatch (I42) — don't drop either guard.
- `pnpm lint` fails repo-wide on pre-existing CRLF line endings + `no-undef` globals on `.mjs`
  files (eslint.config only targets `**/*.js`). Verify a diff's own files with targeted
  `npx eslint <files>` and read past the CRLF noise; don't fix the repo-wide config in passing.
- `native-deck-builder-*.js` (the whole native deck builder UI-wiring layer) has zero unit tests
  — no jsdom harness exists for it in this repo. Pure logic it calls into (deck-state.mjs,
  card-sort.mjs, set-browser.mjs, etc.) IS unit-tested; keep new deck-builder logic there and
  keep the *.js UI files thin callers, so behavior stays testable even though the wiring isn't.
- TCGdex `/cards?category=X` returns its FULL list in one response (no pagination) — Pokemon is
  ~20k rows, Trainer ~3k, Energy much smaller. Fine as a one-time lazy/cached fetch (D18, S106);
  don't call it per-card or per-set-expand, only once per session via the cached index/promise.
